Chronic Kidney Disease

 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for more than 3 months, with implications for health. It is characterized by having kidney damage (most commonly ”spilling” protein into the urine) and/or having decreased kidney function that can become life threatening over time (see Stages of CKD on page 2). In chronic kidney disease, blood pressure often rises as well.

 abnormalities of kidney structure or function

 Abnormalities of kidney structure or function can include malformations before birth, autoimmune diseases, glomerulonephritis, inherited diseases, and chronic kidney disease.

glomerulonephritis

 Glomerulonephritis is a glomerular cause of hematuria, as indicated in the algorithm.

spilling” protein into the urine

 Albuminuria means that the kidney has some damage and is starting to “spill” albumin into the urine.

 Algorithm 3: Evaluating Microscopic Hematuria provides guidance on evaluating microscopic hematuria, which is part of the diagnosis process for acquired cystic kidney disease.

Chronic Kidney Disease

 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition where there is damage to the kidneys and/or decreased kidney function that can become life threatening over time. It is characterized by abnormalities of kidney structure or function that are present for more than 3 months, with implications for health. It is often accompanied by high blood pressure. Treatment focuses on slowing the progression of the disease and managing symptoms.

 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition in which there is damage to the kidneys and/or decreased kidney function that can become life threatening over time. It can be defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for more than 3 months, with implications for health. Management of CKD involves controlling blood pressure, testing for kidney disease, and predicting progression of CKD.

hi

 Hi! Unfortunately, I don't have an answer to your question. However, the National Kidney Foundation website (www.kidney.org) has a lot of useful information about kidney disease and how to fight it.

Chronic Kidney Disease

 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is defined as having kidney damage (most commonly ”spilling” protein into the urine) and/or having decreased kidney function that can become life threatening over time. It can also be associated with high blood pressure. CKD can be managed with lifestyle changes, medications, and other treatments.

hemodialysis

 Hemodialysis is a treatment that replaces some of the work of your own kidneys. Hemodialysis clears wastes and extra fluid from your blood. Your blood is cleaned by a part of the dialysis machine called the artificial kidney or dialyzer. For blood to flow through the dialysis machine, you need to have an access, or entrance, to your bloodstream. This is created by minor surgery, usually to an arm.

Chronic kidney disease

 Chronic kidney disease is usually tested with a physical exam to look for swelling and other visible signs and symptoms, as well as taking one or more tiny pieces (samples) of the kidney to look at with special microscopes. Treatment for chronic kidney disease may include dietary changes and medicines to lower excess salt and fluids in the body, lower loss of protein in the urine, and lower cholesterol in the blood. Certain medicines that suppress, or “calm” the immune system can also be used. It is important to not miss any medical appointments and to talk with your healthcare provider about any new drugs, treatments, and research that can help with your disease.

hemodialysis

 Hemodialysis is a treatment for kidney failure that uses a special filter (called a dialyzer) to remove extra fluids and waste from the body. It is done in a dialysis center by a trained technician or nurse. During the treatment, a patient's blood is pumped outside of their body and through the dialyzer. The dialyzer filters out the extra fluids and waste, and then the clean blood is returned to the body.
